# Brown Dorms Guide
This React.js project was created for a final presentation in CSCI1300: User Interface and User 
Experience.

The assignment was to enhance a previous project to something that would actually be useful for users.
In the Development assignment, we created a sorting site in React.js and this dorm guide came from
that. It uses the Google Maps API to sort by distance from a specified location, which I thought was
pretty cool. Unfortunately due to the ever-changing situation of residential life at Brown, the data
is limited to sophomore dorms and may not be accurate past 2017.

I learned React.js for this class and this is my second ever project in it, so I may not have the
design patterns down ðŸ™ƒ
