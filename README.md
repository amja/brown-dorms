# Brown Dorms Guide
This React.js project was created for a final presentation in CSCI1300: User Interface and User 
Experience.

The assigment was to enhance a previous project to something that would actually be useful for users.
In the Development assignment, we created a sorting site in React.js and this dorm guide came from
that.

It uses the Google Maps API to sort by distance from a specified location.

The data is limited to sophomore dorms and may not be accurate past 2017.
